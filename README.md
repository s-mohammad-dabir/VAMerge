# VAMerge
Very simple and amateur launcher for ffmpeg to just merge video and audio

## Install
Download VAMerge.bat in a folder on your desktop.
To run this script correctly, first you need to download ffmpeg binary file from https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/

## Usage
To combine a video file with an audio file you should use following format:

``
VAMerge.bat <input video file address> <input audio file address> <output video file address>
``
### Example
I want to merge "video.mp4" and "audio.mp3" files together and make "output.mp4" file. Example files are located in "C:\example\". I use following command:

``
VAMerge.bat "C:\example\video.mp4" "C:\example\video.mp3" "C:\example\outpu.mp4"
``
I would like to see you feedback.
